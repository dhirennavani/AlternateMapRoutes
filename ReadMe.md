#Alternate Map Routes

The application is still a work in progress!

Motivation:
During weekends, I along with my friends often used tio head out to some place with natural beauty, but we also wanted to enjoy the food that we can have in between. I thought, what if we select the path from one location to another based on the experience that the user wants to have during the journey. 

Functionality:
The application is expected to find the path based maximum number/rating of desired businesses(restaurants, zoos etc.) in that path.

Technologies
Google Maps JavaScript API, PHP
